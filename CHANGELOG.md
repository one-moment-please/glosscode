# Changelog

What changed in each GlossCode release. The newest release is at the top. Versions follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (see [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md)); while the version starts with `0.`, file formats may still change between releases.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-01

### Editor
- Select whole lines by dragging the mouse across them, with Shift+↑↓ or Shift+click, or all of them with Ctrl+A.
- Right-click selected lines (or any line) to cut, copy, paste, duplicate or delete them. Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V and Delete do the same.
- Copy puts only the G-code on the clipboard, the same text Save writes, so it pastes cleanly into other programs.
- Ctrl+D duplicates the selected lines (or the current line) right below them. Pasting several lines over a selection replaces it.

### Simulation
- Playback goes on to the end of the program (normally M30) instead of stopping at the last move.
- Canned cycles keep Z and R for the following holes, and the tool returns to R (G99) or the starting Z (G98), so Z by line and the final retract are drawn right.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-01

### Editor
- Pasting a few lines or a whole program puts each line in its own row and each word in its own cell.

### Simulation
- Playback pauses at M00. The new M01 button (optional stop) makes it pause at M01 too, and the / button (block delete) skips lines that start with /.
- A line between the buttons and the toolpath shows X and Y (X and Z on a lathe), the line number and its N number, in place of "Up to line".
- Expanded view (⤢ or Ctrl+Shift+E): the toolpath fills most of the window, with a few program lines centered on the active line below it, and Z by line and active modes on the right.

### Fixes
- A block delete "/" at the start of a line is kept as the line's first word (English `BLKDEL`) instead of being dropped when the file was read, so saving no longer loses it.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-01

The first release: a preview for trying GlossCode on real programs. The C core reads, translates and checks the program, and the program opens and saves files; the screen still draws its English words with its own copy of the core's logic, which the tests keep identical.

### Editor
- An English line above every G-code line, each word in a fixed-width column under its English word, in long (`SPINFWD`) or short (`SFWD`) style, or English only.
- Numbers always show their decimal point, and a distance written without one is shown the way the control reads it (`X1` reads `X0.0001`). Feeds and speeds show their unit from the active modes (`S600 rpm` under G97, `S600 sfm` under G96).
- Type G-code or English, with autocomplete, hints for the words a code still needs, and keyboard editing by word.
- Auto N numbering, renumbering, sorting words into a consistent order, undo and redo, and Find across G-code and English.
- Active-modes panel, rapid and feed colors, a step-through simulation and a column view by word type.
- Problems panel with checks for common mistakes on mills and lathes.
- Insert menu: hole patterns (grids and bolt circles), canned cycles by category, and a subprogram library with G65 variables, inserted as a call or written in.
- Subprogram and canned-cycle calls can be expanded inline.

### Machines
- Haas, Fanuc and Okuma mills and lathes, with layered machine definitions and per-machine profiles.

### Program
- Windows (10 and 11, 64-bit) and Linux (64-bit, GTK 3 and WebKitGTK 4.1).
- Starts on a home page with recent programs, New, Open, and default machines by file extension. One tab per open program.
- Uses the system Open and Save dialogs. Saving keeps every unchanged line exactly as it was read, keeps the file's line endings, and writes Latin-1 files back as Latin-1.
- Help › About shows the version and checks GitHub for a newer release.
- Settings are kept in the user's settings folder (`%APPDATA%\GlossCode` on Windows, `~/.config/glosscode` on Linux), or in `GlossCode-data` beside a portable copy.

### Downloads
- Windows installer (per-user, no administrator rights needed) and portable `.zip`.
- Linux `.deb`, `.rpm` and portable `.tar.gz`.
- Sample programs and example library files as a separate `GlossCode-<version>-examples.zip`.

### Known limitations
- The Windows files aren't code-signed, so SmartScreen warns the first time; choose **More info › Run anyway**.
- Check for updates opens the download in the browser; it doesn't yet download and check the file itself.
- Files changed by another program while open aren't reloaded.
