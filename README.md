# GlossCode

GlossCode is a G-code editor that shows a plain-English line above every line of code, with each code lined up under its English word. It tracks active modes, colors rapid and feed moves, and expands subprogram calls inline.

> **Status: design stage.** Nothing is built yet. The screenshots below come from the clickable mockup in [`docs/mockup/`](docs/mockup/index.html).

## What it looks like

Every G-code word sits in a fixed-width column, and its English word sits directly above it:

```
SEQ40      SPINFWD    MODERPM    S6000rpm
N40        M03        G97        S6000

SEQ50      TLENON     LOFS01     Z1.0       COOLON
N50        G43        H01        Z1.0       M08
```

The English words come from a dictionary of consistent abbreviations ([`data/gcode-words.json`](data/gcode-words.json)). Each word has a long style (`SPINFWD`, 10 columns wide) and a short style (`SFWD`, 8 columns wide). Numbers always show their decimal point (`X1.` reads `X1.0`), and a distance written without one is shown the way the control reads it, so `X1` reads `X0.0001`. Feeds and speeds keep their letter and get a small unit that follows the active modes, so `S600` reads `S600 rpm` under G97 and `S600 sfm` under G96.

## Planned features

**Editing**
- Menu bar (File, Edit, View, Insert, Program, Simulate), undo and redo, and Find that matches both G-code and English.
- Edit either line. A toggle (or Caps Lock) switches between typing G-code and typing English, with autocomplete from the dictionary (type `cool` to get COOLON, COOLOFF, and TSCON on a Haas).
- Keyboard editing by word: arrows move between words and lines, Enter edits and Enter again finishes, Space starts the next word, Shift+Enter breaks the line.
- Grey hint text after a code shows the words it still needs (`G02` shows `R## or I## J##`). Click one to fill it in; picking R hides I and J.
- A canned cycle guide (F1) with a sketch of each cycle, an example line, and what every word does.
- Automatic N numbers on new lines (step 10, or the midpoint when there's no room), plus a Renumber command that leaves subprogram labels alone.
- An Insert menu. **Insert › Hole pattern…** is a tool that works out drilling positions and inserts them after the canned-cycle line. Grid mode takes a distance, angle and hole count along each axis; bolt circle mode takes a diameter or radius, hole count, start angle and direction, for a complete circle or an arc spaced by angle or by distance. It follows the active plane (G17 XY, G18 XZ, G19 YZ) and G90/G91, and writes every number with a decimal point.
- Canned cycles from the Insert menu, grouped by category (drilling, tapping, boring on a mill; roughing, finishing, turning and facing, grooving, threading, drilling and live tooling on a lathe). Each opens a window with a rough sketch of the cycle, a box for each word it takes (required ones marked, with what each does), and the finished line with its English before it goes in. Categories the selected machine can't run are hidden, such as live tooling on a lathe without it, and Y and C words are hidden on lathes without a Y axis or live tooling. Those options are set in the machine profile.
- A subprogram library: reusable subprograms with named variables (a slotting routine where only the positions and depths change between parts). Find one under **Insert › Subprogram library…**, fill in the values, and insert it as one `G65 P9101 …` call or as plain lines worked out from the values for controls without the macro option. Calls read by name in English (`SLOTMILL`, `DEP-0.15`) and expand to show the lines they run. Library files live in built-in, shop or personal folders, like machine definitions. See [`docs/subprogram-library.md`](docs/subprogram-library.md).
- Warnings when a word clashes with the active mode, such as an inches-per-rev feed while G94 is on.
- A Problems panel that checks the program as you type: canned cycles missing words (G83 with no Q), feed moves with no F or with the spindle off, a word repeated in a line, two codes from one group, numbers with no decimal point, arcs that don't close, missing length offsets, and codes that mean something else on the selected control (G54 on an Okuma). See [`docs/checks.md`](docs/checks.md).
- Opens and saves through the standard system file dialog, and keeps each file's original line endings.

**Reading**
- Show both lines, English only, or G-code only.
- Two layouts: words in program order, or columns by word type (motion and cycle codes first, then X, Y, Z, F, S and the spindle M-codes, with rare words at the end). In columns, modal values still in effect from earlier lines show in grey in the empty cells, and lines that don't move the machine (program number, safety line, M30, subprogram calls) keep their words in program order. A Sort command puts the words on each line in a consistent order.
- Subprogram and canned-cycle calls (for example Haas `M97 P1000`) expand inline below the call, marked with purple N numbers. Editing an expanded row edits the subprogram itself.
- An active-modes panel for the selected line: motion, units, absolute or incremental, plane, feed mode and rate, spindle, coolant, tool and offsets. A dot marks modes set on that line.
- Line colors by motion: amber for rapid, blue for feed, teal for arcs, magenta for drilling cycles.

**Previews**
- XY toolpath view that follows subprogram calls, colored by move type or by tool. Moves after the selected line can be greyed out, hidden, or shown normally.
- Simulation playback that draws the tool moves one line at a time, with step, play and speed controls.
- A "Z by line" timeline in execution order that keeps the selected line centered.

**Machines**
- Mill and lathe modes, since some codes mean different things on each (G50, G76, G98, G99).
- Per-machine definition files that override dictionary entries (for example Haas M88/M89 and M97).
- An end-of-block setting per machine profile for older controls that need `;` at the end of every line.
- Haas and Fanuc mills and lathes, plus a first draft of Okuma OSP (G15 H work offsets, G56 H length offsets, CALL and RTS). [`docs/checks.md`](docs/checks.md) lists what each control covers so far.

See [`docs/features.md`](docs/features.md) for the full list and what is still under discussion.

## Platform plan

Windows first, with a native Linux build later.

- **Core in portable C**: parser, translator, mode tracking, checks and dictionary loading. Only the C standard library, no `windows.h`, UTF-8 throughout.
- **One small platform file per OS**: `platform_win32.c` now, `platform_linux.c` later, each with the same handful of functions (read and write files, watch for changes, find the settings folder, open the window).
- **UI in a native webview** through the [webview](https://github.com/webview/webview) library: WebView2 on Windows 10/11, WebKitGTK on Linux. The same HTML/JS UI runs on both.
- **System file dialogs** through [nativefiledialog-extended](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended).
- **Build with MinGW-w64 or clang** so the same toolchain works on both systems.

More detail is in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Try the mockup

Open [`docs/mockup/index.html`](docs/mockup/index.html) in any browser. Click a word to edit it (or use the arrow keys and Enter), switch the Edit, Words and Show toggles, and use **▸ show N1000** to expand the subprogram. Press F1 on a canned cycle to see how it works. It loads its fonts from Google Fonts, so it looks best online.
