# Architecture

GlossCode targets Windows first. Everything is arranged so that a native Linux build is mostly a recompile.

### Core (portable C)

- **Parser**: splits each line into words (`N40`, `M03`, `G97`, `S6000`) and keeps comments whole. Remembers each file's line endings, since G-code is often CRLF.
- **Mode tracker**: walks the program in execution order, following subprogram calls, and records the modal state after every line: motion, units, G90/G91, plane, feed mode and rate, spindle, coolant, tool, offsets and compensation.
- **Translator**: turns each word into its English word using the dictionary and the active modes. Values take a unit prefix (`RPM600` under G97, `SFM600` under G96, `IPM25` under G94 and G20).
- **Checks**: one pass in execution order that carries the machine state and reports problems such as a canned cycle missing a word, a feed move with no F or with the spindle off, a word repeated in a line, or a code that means something else on this control. Rule text and per-control tables come from `gcode-rules.json`; see [checks.md](checks.md).
- **Dictionary loader**: reads `gcode-words.json` and merges machine definition overrides on top.

Rules for the core: C standard library only (`stdio`, `stdlib`, `string`), no `windows.h`, UTF-8 everywhere, `/` in paths, and no compiler-specific extensions.

The core lives in `src/core/`: `gc_doc.c` (reading and writing files), `gc_data.c` (data files, dialect chain, dictionary lookups), `gc_translate.c` (mode tracker and translator), `gc_checks.c` (checks), and `gc_api.c` (the JSON methods the UI calls). It follows the mockup's JavaScript line for line, and `tests/test_golden.c` checks that both give the same English and the same problems for every sample program; see [building.md](building.md#tests). A file that isn't valid UTF-8 is read as Latin-1, as older controls and DNC software write, and saved back as Latin-1.

### Platform file

One file per OS with the same small set of functions:

| Function | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| List a folder | `FindFirstFileW` | `opendir` |
| Read / write a file (written to a temporary file, then swapped in) | `CreateFileW`, `MoveFileExW` | `open`, `rename` |
| Watch a file for changes (not written yet) | `ReadDirectoryChangesW` | `inotify` |
| Settings folder | `%APPDATA%\GlossCode` | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glosscode` (usually `~/.config/glosscode`) |
| Open / save dialog | nativefiledialog-extended (`IFileOpenDialog`) | nativefiledialog-extended (GTK / portal) |
| Create the window | webview (WebView2) | webview (WebKitGTK) |

### UI

The UI is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript loaded into the webview. It talks to the core through the webview library's bind calls, passing JSON (`window.GlossCodeNative`, listed in [building.md](building.md#how-the-ui-talks-to-the-program)). For now the program shows the clickable mockup in [`mockup/index.html`](mockup/index.html) itself: in the program, the page around the window is hidden and the window fills the screen.

## Build

- MinGW-w64 or clang on Windows, gcc or clang on Linux.
- Avoid .NET, MFC, the registry and MSVC-only features.
- WebView2 ships with Windows 10 and 11, so the .exe stays small.

## Packaging

GlossCode ships as **one executable**. Nothing it needs to start sits beside it.

- **The UI is embedded.** The HTML, CSS and JavaScript are compiled into the program (a generated C array, or a Windows resource) and served to the webview from memory.
- **The built-in data is embedded.** `gcode-words.json`, `gcode-rules.json`, the built-in machine definitions and the built-in subprogram library are compiled in the same way. They are read-only and are replaced by each release.
- **Windows**: build with `-static` so the MinGW runtime is inside the .exe, and use the webview library's built-in WebView2 loader so `WebView2Loader.dll` isn't needed. The WebView2 runtime itself comes with Windows 10 and 11.
- **Linux**: the same single executable, linked against the system's GTK and WebKitGTK packages, which are listed as dependencies rather than bundled. An AppImage or distribution package can come later if needed.
- A development flag (`--data <folder>`) loads the built-in files from a folder on disk instead, so tables can be edited without a rebuild.

### Where user files go

The program never writes beside itself. Everything the user or shop creates goes in the platform's standard user data folder:

| What | Windows | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Settings, personal machine definitions, personal library | `%APPDATA%\GlossCode\` (`machines\`, `library\`) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/glosscode/` (usually `~/.config/glosscode/`) |
| WebView data and caches (safe to delete) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GlossCode\` | `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/glosscode/` (usually `~/.cache/glosscode/`) |
| Shop folder | Wherever Settings points (often a network path) | Same |

The WebView2 user data folder must be set to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GlossCode\WebView2` explicitly; by default WebView2 creates it beside the .exe, which fails under `Program Files`.

To change a built-in machine, the user picks **Make my own copy** (a new file that `extends` the built-in one) or saves a file with the same id in the personal or shop folder to replace it (marked **modified built-in**). **Export** writes out any built-in file for reference. Because the built-in files are inside the program, an update can never overwrite a user's changes, and a user's changes can never break the built-in files.

### Portable mode

If a file named `portable` sits beside the .exe, GlossCode keeps settings, personal files and caches in a `GlossCode-data` folder beside the .exe instead. This is for running from a USB drive or a shared folder at the machine. Without that file, the standard folders above are used.

## Data files

- `data/gcode-words.json`: the base dictionary. Each code has `long` and `short` words and a description. Codes that differ between machine types have `mill` and `lathe` entries.
- `data/gcode-rules.json`: the checks' messages and severities, and per-control tables (Fanuc, Haas, Okuma; mill and lathe) that inherit from each other. The same tables drive the hint text for missing words (`wordHints` plus the cycle word lists), and `cycleHelp` holds the canned cycle guide's text.
- Machine profiles (`machines/<id>.json`, see machine definitions below): name, control, dialect, mill or lathe, limits, brand codes, and `eob` (true when every line must end with `;`). The parser treats `;` as an end of block on every machine; the writer adds it when the profile says so.
- The mockup embeds both files. After changing either, run `node scripts/sync-mockup-data.mjs`.
- Machine definitions: per-machine JSON files built in layers (process base, control, model, shop machine) that hold the words, cycles and check settings for each machine. Proposed in [machine-definitions.md](machine-definitions.md).
